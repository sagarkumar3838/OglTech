## How to Use

### 1. Select Your Career
Click on any career button at the top to view analytics for that career.

### 2. View Overall Stats
See 4 key metrics:
- **Total Tests**: How many tests you've taken
- **Average Score**: Your overall performance
- **Tests Passed**: Tests where you scored ≥ 60%
- **Need Practice**: Tests where you scored < 60%

### 3. Check Skill Progress
For each skill (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.):
- See your best score and average score
- View attempts at each level (Easy, Medium, Hard)
- Green ✅ = Passed, Red ❌ = Failed, Gray = Not attempted

### 4. Identify Areas to Improve
- Red cards show skills/levels that need practice
- Gray cards show levels you haven't tried yet
- Green cards show your strengths

## What the Colors Mean

- **Green (80%+)**: Excellent! You've mastered this
- **Yellow (60-79%)**: Good! Keep practicing
- **Red (<60%)**: Needs work - practice more

## Tips

- Focus on completing all skills at Medium level first
- Retake tests to improve your scores
