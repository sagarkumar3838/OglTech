STEP-BY-STEP: RUN DATABASE CLEANUP
============================================

Your 6000 questions have been uploaded to Supabase, but they need cleanup:
- Level names are "BASIC/INTERMEDIATE/ADVANCED" (need to be "easy/medium/hard")
- May contain duplicate questions
- May contain unwanted skills

STEPS TO FIX:
============================================

1. Open Supabase Dashboard:
   https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/ksjgsgebjnpwyycnptom/editor

2. Click "SQL Editor" in the left sidebar

3. Click "New Query" button

4. Copy ALL content from "complete-cleanup.sql" file

5. Paste into the SQL Editor

6. Click "Run" button (or press Ctrl+Enter)

7. Wait for execution (may take 30-60 seconds)

8. Check the output - you should see:
   - BEFORE CLEANUP: Shows current state
   - After removing unwanted skills: Shows remaining count
   - After standardizing levels: Shows easy/medium/hard counts
   - After removing duplicates: Shows final count
   - FINAL STATE: Shows breakdown by skill and level

EXPECTED RESULTS:
============================================
- Levels converted: BASIC→easy, INTERMEDIATE→medium, ADVANCED→hard
- Duplicate questions removed
- Only skills needed for 8 OGL courses kept:
  * html, css, javascript, jquery (Content Developer)
  * typescript, react, nodejs (Frontend/Backend/Full-stack)
  * python, java (Backend)
  * testing tools (Tester/QA)
  * cloud platforms, docker, kubernetes, ci/cd, serverless, microservices (DevOps/Cloud)
  * oglknowledge (OGL specific knowledge)

AFTER CLEANUP:
============================================
1. Test the evaluation page at: http://localhost:3000/evaluation
2. Select a skill and level
3. Verify 10 unique questions load correctly
4. Check that timer works (10 minutes)
5. Submit test and verify scorecard

TROUBLESHOOTING:
============================================
If you get an error:
- Check that you're using the correct Supabase project
- Make sure you have admin access
- Try running the script in smaller sections

If questions still don't load:
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify Supabase connection in client/.env
- Check that VITE_SUPABASE_URL and VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY are correct
