# ONE SOLUTION - Fix Everything

## The Simple Truth

You already have all 9,464 questions in your `questions` table!

The ONLY problem: levels are named `Basic/Intermediate/Advanced` but your frontend expects `easy/medium/hard`.

## ONE SQL File to Fix Everything

Run: `FIX_EVERYTHING_NOW.sql`

This will:
1. Convert ALL levels in your `questions` table
   - Basic → easy
   - Intermediate → medium
   - Advanced → hard
2. Show verification results
3. Done!

## No Need To:
- ❌ Copy from practice_questions
- ❌ Add columns
- ❌ Check column names
- ❌ Multiple steps

## Just:
✅ Run ONE SQL file
✅ All questions appear in frontend
✅ All skills working

## After Running

You'll see:
```
=== TOTAL QUESTIONS ===
total_questions: 9464

=== LEVELS BREAKDOWN ===
easy: ~3,155
medium: ~3,155
hard: ~3,154

=== DEVTOOLS VERIFICATION ===
easy: 95
medium: 248
hard: 110
```

Your frontend will immediately show all questions with correct levels!
