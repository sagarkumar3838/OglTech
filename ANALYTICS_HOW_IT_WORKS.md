# Analytics Page - How It Works

## 🎯 Career-Specific Data

The Analytics page now shows data ONLY for the selected career.

## Example:

### Your Test History:
```
1. HTML Easy - OGL Content Developer - 85%
2. CSS Easy - OGL Content Developer - 80%
3. HTML Easy - OGL Tester - 90%
4. JavaScript Easy - OGL Tester - 75%
```

### When You Select "OGL Content Developer":
```
Overall Stats:
- Total Tests: 2
- Average Score: 82.5%

Skills:
- HTML: Easy 85%
- CSS: Easy 80%
```

### When You Select "OGL Tester":
```
Overall Stats:
- Total Tests: 2
- Average Score: 82.5%

Skills:
- HTML: Easy 90%
- JavaScript: Easy 75%
```

## 🔑 Key Point

**Same skill (HTML), different careers = different data!**

- HTML for "OGL Content Developer" shows 85%
- HTML for "OGL Tester" shows 90%
- They are tracked separately

## ✅ This Is Correct Because:

1. Tests are taken in context of a specific career
2. Each career has its own learning path
3. Your progress in one career is independent of another
4. You might be at different levels in the same skill for different careers

## 🎨 Visual Indicator
