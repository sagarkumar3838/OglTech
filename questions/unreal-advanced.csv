When would you create Actor Component vs modifying Actor directly?,Architecture,Actor Component,Reusability,Actor Component encapsulates reusable functionality that can be added to multiple Actors. Create when: functionality needed by multiple Actor types, or when separating concerns. Modify Actor directly when: functionality is specific to one Actor type, or when component overhead isn't justified.,https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.3/en-US/actor-components-in-unreal-engine/,https://youtube.com/results?search_query=unreal+actor+component,https://youtube.com/results?search_query=unreal+component+hindi,https://youtube.com/results?search_query=unreal+component+kannada,https://youtube.com/results?search_query=unreal+component+tamil,https://youtube.com/results?search_query=unreal+component+telugu
Unreal Engine,Advanced,What is Unreal Engine's Scene Component for hierarchical transforms? When would you use Scene Component vs other components?,Architecture,Scene Component,Transform,Scene Component provides transform hierarchy within Actor. Use when: needing child transforms (weapon attached to hand, camera to head), or spatial organization. Other components (Actor, Primitive) for: when transform hierarchy not needed, or specific functionality required.,https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.3/en-US/scene-components-in-unreal-engine/,https://youtube.com/results?search_query=unreal+scene+component,https://youtube.com/results?search_query=unreal+scene+hindi,https://youtube.com/results?search_query=unreal+scene+kannada,https://youtube.com/results?search_query=unreal+scene+tamil,https://youtube.com/results?search_query=unreal+scene+telugu
Unreal Engine,Advanced,How does Unreal Engine's Primitive Component render geometry? When would you choose different primitive components?,Rendering,Primitive Component,Geometry,Primitive Component renders geometry: Static Mesh (non-moving), Skeletal Mesh (animated), Instanced Static Mesh (many copies). Choose based on needs: Static for environment, Skeletal for characters, Instanced for many identical objects (trees, rocks).,https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.3/en-US/primitive-components-in-unreal-engine/,https://youtube.com/results?search_query=unreal+primitive+component,https://youtube.com/results?search_query=unreal+primitive+hindi,https://youtube.com/results?search_query=unreal+primitive+kannada,https://youtube.com/results?search_query=unreal+primitive+tamil,https://youtube.com/results?search_query=unreal+primitive+telugu
Unreal Engine,Advanced,Explain Unreal Engine's Collision Component for physics interaction. When would you customize collision vs using mesh collision?,Physics,Collision Component,Interaction,Collision Component defines physics interaction shape (box, sphere, capsule, custom). Customize when: simpler collision needed for performance, specific interaction shape, or when mesh collision is too complex. Mesh collision for: accurate collision matching visual mesh.,https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.3/en-US/collision-components-in-unreal-engine/,https://youtube.com/results?search_query=unreal+collision+component,https://youtube.com/results?search_query=unreal+collision+hindi,https://youtube.com/results?search_query=unreal+collision+kannada,https://youtube.com/results?search_query=unreal+collision+tamil,https://youtube.com/results?search_query=unreal+collision+telugu
