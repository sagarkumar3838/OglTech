"Terraform","Intermediate","What is the difference between Terraform state and configuration?","Core Concepts","State Management","State vs Config","Configuration (.tf files) describes desired infrastructure. State (.tfstate) records actual deployed resources and their properties. Configuration is what you want, state is what exists. Terraform reconciles them to determine changes needed.","https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/state","https://youtube.com/results?search_query=terraform+state+vs+configuration","https://youtube.com/results?search_query=terraform+state+vs+configuration+hindi","https://youtube.com/results?search_query=terraform+state+vs+configuration+kannada","https://youtube.com/results?search_query=terraform+state+vs+configuration+tamil","https://youtube.com/results?search_query=terraform+state+vs+configuration+telugu"
"Terraform","Intermediate","What are Terraform providers and how do they work?","Core Concepts","Providers","Purpose","Providers are plugins that interact with APIs (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.).
