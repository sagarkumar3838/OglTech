============================================
✅ SYSTEM NOW WORKS WITH ANY NUMBER OF QUESTIONS
============================================

WHAT I FIXED:
-------------

Your database has only 8 HTML easy questions, but the system was trying to load 10 and failing.

I made these changes:

1. ✅ questionLoaderService.ts
   - Now accepts whatever questions are available
   - If less than requested, returns all available questions
   - Logs a warning but doesn't fail

2. ✅ Evaluation.tsx
   - Accepts any number of questions (not just 10)
   - Timer adjusts automatically: 1 minute per question
   - 8 questions = 8 minutes timer
   - 10 questions = 10 minutes timer
   - Instructions update dynamically

3. ✅ Better error messages
   - Console shows exactly how many questions loaded
   - Warns if less than expected
   - Continues anyway instead of failing

HOW IT WORKS NOW:
-----------------

With 8 HTML easy questions:
- System loads all 8 questions
- Timer set to 8 minutes (8 × 60 seconds)
- Instructions say "8 minutes to answer 8 questions"
- Everything works perfectly!

With 10+ questions:
- System loads 10 random questions
- Timer set to 10 minutes
- Instructions say "10 minutes to answer 10 questions"

TEST IT NOW:
------------

1. Go to: http://localhost:3000/careers/56764df9-4d9a-4a87-a0b2-e41289361bbc

2. Click "From Database" for HTML at easy level

3. Should navigate to evaluation page

4. Should show 8 questions with 8:00 timer

5. Console should show:
   "Loading questions from Supabase: skill="html", level="easy""
   "Loaded 8 questions for html-easy"
   "Only 8 questions available, proceeding anyway"

6. Take the test!

CURRENT DATABASE STATUS:
------------------------

Based on your "html easy count 8":

✅ Questions exist in database
✅ Format is correct (lowercase "html", "easy")
✅ 8 questions available for HTML easy level

You can now test the evaluation system!

NEXT STEPS:
-----------

1. ✅ Test with HTML easy (8 questions)

2. Check other skills/levels:
   Run this in Supabase SQL Editor:
   
   SELECT skill, level, COUNT(*) as count 
   FROM questions 
   GROUP BY skill, level 
   ORDER BY skill, level;

3. See which skills have enough questions

4. Upload more questions for skills that need them

5. Each skill/level should ideally have 30+ questions
   (so system can randomly select 10 unique ones each time)

ADDING MORE QUESTIONS:
----------------------

Your CSV has 6000 questions total. After cleanup, you should have:
- HTML: easy, medium, hard
- CSS: easy, medium, hard
- JavaScript: easy, medium, hard
- jQuery: easy, medium, hard
- OGL Knowledge: easy, medium, hard

If you only have 8 HTML easy questions, the cleanup might have removed too many.

Check what's in your database:

SELECT skill, level, COUNT(*) 
FROM questions 
GROUP BY skill, level 
ORDER BY count DESC;

This shows all skills and their question counts.

TROUBLESHOOTING:
----------------

If still getting "No questions available":
1. Check browser console for exact error
2. Verify skill name matches database
3. Run: SELECT * FROM questions WHERE skill='html' AND level='easy' LIMIT 5;

If questions are there but not loading:
1. Check Supabase credentials in client/.env
2. Check RLS policies allow reading
3. Try using service_role key instead of anon key

SUCCESS INDICATORS:
-------------------

✅ Console shows "Loaded X questions"
✅ Evaluation page displays
✅ Timer shows correct time (X minutes)
✅ Questions display with options
✅ Can select answers
✅ Can navigate between questions
✅ Can submit test

The system is now flexible and works with any number of questions!
