============================================
🚨 PROBLEM FOUND: CSV HAS MASSIVE DUPLICATES
============================================

ISSUE:
------
Your CSV file "ogl_developer_questions_combined_3000_cleaned.csv" has:
- 6000 total rows
- Only 38 UNIQUE questions
- Each question repeated ~200 times!

Example:
"In OGL, to clear the canvas..." appears 200 times
"What is the purpose of the OGL function..." appears 200 times

This is why after removing duplicates, you only have 30-38 questions.

SOLUTION OPTIONS:
-----------------

OPTION 1: Find the correct CSV file
------------------------------------
You need a CSV with actual unique questions, not duplicates.

Check if you have other CSV files:
- Look for files with names like:
  * questions.csv
  * ogl_questions.csv
  * developer_questions.csv
  * questions_unique.csv

OPTION 2: Generate questions with AI
-------------------------------------
Use the AI generation feature in your app:
1. Go to career page
2. Click "AI Generated" button
3. System generates 10 unique questions
4. Questions are saved to database automatically

Do this for each skill/level you need.

OPTION 3: Create questions manually
------------------------------------
Use ChatGPT or another AI to generate questions:

Prompt:
"Generate 100 unique HTML questions at easy level in CSV format with columns: skill,level,type,question,option_a,option_b,option_c,option_d,correct_answer,explanation"

Then save as CSV and upload.

OPTION 4: Use sample questions
-------------------------------
Check if you have sample-questions.json or similar files in your project.

CURRENT DATABASE STATE:
-----------------------
You now have ~30 unique questions:
- html: 10 questions (4 easy, 4 medium, 2 hard)
- javascript: 10 questions (4 easy, 4 medium, 2 hard)
- jquery: 4 questions (4 easy)
- oglknowledge: 4 questions (4 easy)

This is enough to TEST the system, but not enough for production.

TESTING NOW:
------------
You can test the app right now with these 30 questions:
1. Go to career page
2. Click "From Database" for HTML easy
3. Should load 4 questions (all you have)
4. System will work, just with fewer questions

RECOMMENDED ACTION:
-------------------
1. Test the app now with 30 questions (verify it works)
2. Then generate more questions using one of the options above
3. Or find the correct CSV file with actual unique questions

The CSV file you have is corrupted/malformed with duplicates.
You need a different source for questions.

WHERE TO GET QUESTIONS:
-----------------------
1. Use AI generation in the app (easiest)
2. Generate with ChatGPT/Claude (see CHATGPT_PROMPTS_FOR_QUESTIONS.md)
3. Find a proper question bank CSV online
4. Create your own questions

NEXT STEPS:
-----------
1. Test app now (works with 30 questions)
2. Decide on question source
3. Generate/upload more questions
4. Aim for 30+ questions per skill/level minimum
